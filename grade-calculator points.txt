🎯 Next Steps
Would you like me to:
✅ Enable TypeScript strict mode and fix any errors?
🧪 Add unit tests for calculator functions?
♿ Improve accessibility with ARIA labels?
📦 Optimize bundle sizes further?
🐛 Add error boundaries?
📚 Create comprehensive documentation?
The project is production-ready and well-built! The main improvements would be enabling strict TypeScript, adding tests, and minor accessibility enhancements.
